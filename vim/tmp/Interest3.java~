/*
 * This class implements a simple program that will compute the amount of
 * interest that is earned on an investment over a period of 5  years. The
 * initial amount of the investment and the interest rate are each input by the
 * user. The value of the investment at the end of each year is output.
 *
 * Copied from http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/c3/s1.html. Modified to use 
 * java.util.Scanner instead of TextIO and to use user input to decide how many 
 * years to simulate the investment for. Written on 02-09-2015 by Jesse Evers.
